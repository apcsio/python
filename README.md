# APCS Python library

The APCS graphics library for Python uses the same method names as the [Java](http://apcs.io) and [JavaScript](http://apcs.io/js/apcs.js) libraries.

## Prerequisites

- You have Python 3 installed on your computer.
- You have a text editor installed that can highlight Python code (I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io)).
- You can [use the command line to navigate the file system](https://techlab.education/bash/file-system).

## Getting started

With the Terminal application, use `mkdir` to make a folder somewhere on the computer, then `cd` into the folder. Once you're in the folder where you will be storing your files, open your text editor and click `File > Open`. Select the same folder.
